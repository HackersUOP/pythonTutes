This is the hello world application for python
For to be advance we have used integers, floats, Strings and try to connect them and print
'''
x = 5 #integer
y = 1.2 #float
z = 'UOP' #String
a = "UOP" #String

print str(x) + str(y) + z + a #For "+" all should be converted to string before concat them.
print x , y , z + a #For ',' no need to convert them for concat but space will be given automatically before the value.
